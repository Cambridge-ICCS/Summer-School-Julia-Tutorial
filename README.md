## Install Julia

If you have not done so, download Julia from https://julialang.org/downloads/. 

## Install Julia Packages

In a Julia interactive session, you can install packages by entering `]` (which changes the prompt to `pkg>`) followed by `add PACKAGE`. Now try to install the web-based notebook `Pluto`.

## Run a Pluto Notebook Session

Enter a backspace to return to the normal mode from the package mode. Then run `using Pluto; Pluto.run()` to open a Pluto Notebook session (a webpage will automatically pop up).
